I am designing a tool which gathers user responses on questions around quality of life aspects for housing and recommends them areas to live in.
I have decided to use 7 indexes of measuring quality of life with each one of them having multiple factors. Alongside these indexes to understand user demographics we also get number of adults, children and pets in the family
Here is the information for the indexes
First index is sense of control which has 4 factors in it cost of living, essential services, safety and influence and contribution
Second index is a sense of wonder which has 2 factors play & recreation and distinctive design & culture
Third index is connected communities which has 2 factors local business and jobs and belonging
Fourth index is connection to nature which has 3 factors biodiversity, climate resilience and adaptation, and green and blue spaces
Fifth index is getting around which has 3 factors cars, public transport and walking and cycling
Sixth index is health equity which has 3 factors air noise light, food choice, and housing standards

Here are the questions and responses gathered from a user on these indexes and factors:

Here is the task, you have to create a JSON object which contains index, factor and score of 0 to 100 for each factor based on the questions and user response from above data
Here is an example JSON, please use just the JSON structure for creating the output and do not use the numbers in JSON for your calculation
